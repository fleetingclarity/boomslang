## Authentication

The installer supports two authentication methods for private repositories:

### GitLab CLI (Recommended)
```bash
glab auth login --hostname gitlab.yourorg.com
```

### SSH Keys
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@yourorg.com"
# Add public key to GitLab settings
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Zero-config installation (most common)
./boomslang-install.sh

# Dry run to see what would be installed
./boomslang-install.sh --dry-run

# Override repository for testing
./boomslang-install.sh --repo gitlab.acme.com/devtools/amazonq-standards-dev

# Uninstall with confirmation
./boomslang-install.sh --uninstall

# Force uninstall without prompts
./boomslang-install.sh --uninstall --force
```

### Using Profiles

After installation, profiles are available in Amazon Q:

```bash
# Start Amazon Q chat
q chat

# Switch to engineer profile for development tasks
/profile set engineer

# Switch to reviewer profile for code reviews  
/profile set reviewer

# Switch to architect profile for system design
/profile set architect
```
