# Boomslang: Amazon Q CLI Standards Manager

## Project Overview
Boomslang is a template repository that organizations can fork and customize to distribute their Amazon Q Developer CLI standards. It provides a simple way for organizations to define custom context profiles and distribute them via a lightweight install script for easy team adoption. Amazon Q Developer CLI is AWS's AI-powered agentic coding assistant that provides natural language chat, command auto-completion for hundreds of CLIs, code generation, and AWS resource management capabilities.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Template Repository**: Provide a forkable template for organizations to customize Amazon Q Developer CLI standards
- **Easy Customization**: Enable organization maintainers to modify context profiles for their specific needs
- **Simple Distribution**: Provide scripts to validate and distribute organization standards
- **Frictionless Installation**: Allow team members to install organization standards via simple install script

### Secondary Goals
- **Multi-profile Support**: Handle different context profiles for various development tasks and workflows
- **Version Management**: Enable versioned releases of organization standards
- **Documentation**: Provide clear guidance for customization and deployment

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Features
1. **Template Repository**
   - Provide base context profiles for common development workflows
   - Include customizable organization standards sections
   - Support multiple context profiles (code-reviewer, security-analyst, performance-optimizer, etc.)
   - Version control all configuration changes
   - Maintain clear documentation for customization

2. **Distribution System**
   - Lightweight install script with dry-run and uninstall support
   - GitLab CLI integration with SSH fallback for private repositories
   - Clean installation that replaces existing configurations
   - Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)

3. **Installation Process**
   - Zero-config `./boomslang-install.sh` command for end users
   - Automatic placement of profiles in `$HOME/.aws/amazonq/profiles/`
   - Installation tracking with recovery options

4. **Customization Workflow**
   - Fork boomslang repository
   - Modify context profiles in `configs/.amazonq/profiles/`
   - Validate profiles with validation script
   - Distribute install script to team

#### Amazon Q Developer CLI Configuration Management
- **Chat Context Management**: Standardize conversation contexts and behavior settings
- **Profile Settings**: Manage user profiles and personalization preferences
- **Command Completion Settings**: Standardize auto-completion behavior for supported CLIs (git, npm, docker, aws, etc.)
- **Agentic Behavior Configuration**: Control AI assistant capabilities and permissions
- **AWS Integration Settings**: Manage CloudShell integration and AWS resource access configurations
- **Keyword-activated Context Profiles**: Context profiles that activate based on specific keywords or phrases, allowing for specialized AI behavior (code review, security analysis, performance optimization, etc.)
- **Template-based Configuration Generation**: Dynamic configuration creation based on organization needs
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure settings compatibility and prevent broken states

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Configuration updates complete within 30 seconds
- Minimal impact on system resources
- Efficient delta updates (only changed files)

#### Reliability
- Atomic updates (all-or-nothing configuration changes)
- Automatic backup before any configuration change
- Graceful handling of network failures
- Configuration validation to prevent broken states

#### Security
- Secure communication with Git repository
- Support for private repositories with authentication
- Configuration signing/verification (optional)
- No storage of sensitive credentials in configurations

#### Usability
- Zero-configuration setup for standard use cases
- Clear error messages and recovery instructions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Integration with existing development workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Template Repository**: Base boomslang repository with sample context profiles
2. **Install Script**: Lightweight installation script with authentication handling
3. **Validation Script**: Rule validation and quality checking
4. **Context Profiles**: Markdown files defining keyword-activated AI behavior

### Distribution Strategy
- **Template Distribution**: Public repository for organizations to fork (GitHub/GitLab)
- **Internal Distribution**: Private GitLab repositories with authenticated access
- **Cross-platform**: Works on any Unix-like system (macOS, Linux)

### Repository Structure
```

```

## Success Metrics
- Template fork and customization < 30 minutes
- Rule validation and testing < 5 minutes
- Team member installation < 2 minutes via install script
- 90%+ adoption rate within target organizations
- Clear documentation reduces support requests to < 5%

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Fork divergence**: Clear documentation and template updates
- **Rule conflicts**: Validation scripts to check rule syntax
- **Authentication issues**: Support for both GitLab CLI and SSH authentication
- **Platform compatibility**: Shell script compatibility across Unix-like systems

## Timeline and Milestones
1. **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-2): Template repository with sample context profiles
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 3-4): Install script with authentication and validation
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Documentation and testing
4. **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Final testing, error handling, and release preparation

## Future Enhancements
- Community marketplace for sharing context profiles
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated updates
- Web dashboard for rule management and analytics
- Support for additional Git hosting platforms
- Advanced rule validation and testing frameworks
- Integration with organization identity providers
- Support for other AI-powered CLI tools beyond Amazon Q Developer
